Solution:
(after have opened ghidra to see the structure of the program)

1. catch the syscall PTRACE in order to set the rax register to 0 (so ptrace doesn't know that there's GDB)

2.put a breakpoint in strncmp and then click continue in order to arrive to this breakpoint

3.exit from strncmp and we'll see in the rdi register the value of the flag
