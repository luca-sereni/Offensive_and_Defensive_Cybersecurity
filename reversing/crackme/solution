Solution:

-looking at ghidra, I found that there's a function which is called when the signal SIGTRAP is triggered. Inside that function, there's a loop that xor between a key and my input in  order to get another value

-if I xor the value we want to obtain and the key (both can be retrieved in hexadecimal inside ghidra) I can obtain the flag.

flag{l0v3ly_4nt1r3v_tr1ck5_w_s1gn4l5}
