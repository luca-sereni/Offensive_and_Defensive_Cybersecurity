#First, I leak the address of text section by modifying only the last byte of sEIP of challenge() in order to
#go back before the call to challenge (printf prints the address). With gdb, i compute the offset between this address
#and win address and also of the input buffer and sEIP of main (because this isn't xored with canary). After compute
#these offset, I use as input the offset of input buffer computed before as index (from 104 to 109 with values, from 110 to 111
# with zeros --> IMPORTANT) and as values the decimal values of the bytes that compose the win address. Then when i press -1
# Ã¬t returns correctly from challenge but when it returns from main it calls win function.
