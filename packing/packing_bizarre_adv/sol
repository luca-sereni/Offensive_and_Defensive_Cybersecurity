SOLUTION:
After proceeded with the decode, we received 4 strings:1,2,3,4. Basically it executes the xor among a byte of 1 with a byte of our flag. If the result of the xor is equal to the byte in 3, it keeps doing the same. It does the same thing with string 2 and checks the result wrt string 4. Then it changes the payload and repeat the decode function. When it finishes we have 4 new strings and it does the same thing. To have the solution, we have to do the xor among one byte of a string and the byte we should have after xoring our flag with the string.
